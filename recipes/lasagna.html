        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Brown the ground beef and Italian sausage 
                in a large skillet over medium-high heat. 
                Drain excess grease. Stir in the water and 
                black olives, and season with basil, garlic 
                powder, oregano, sage, pepper, minced garlic, 
                and onion flakes. Simmer for about 15 minutes, 
                stirring frequently. Stir in the marinara 
                sauce, and remove from the heat.
            </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Preheat the oven to 375 degrees 
                    F (190 degrees C).
                </p>
            </li>

                <p>
                    Place a layer of the meat and sauce in the 
                    bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Cover 
                    with a layer of dry noodles. Spread a thin 
                    layer of ricotta cheese over the noodles, 
                    and sprinkle with a little mozzarella 
                    cheese. Cover with another layer of sauce, 
                    and repeat layering ending with the meat and 
                    sauce on top. Reserve about 1/2 cup of mozzarella 
                    cheese for later.

                    Bake for 45 minutes in the preheated oven, 
                    but check after 30 minutes depending on how 
                    thick the lasagna is. Lasagna is cooked when 
                    you can easily stick a knife into it. 
                    Sprinkle the reserved cheese over the top, 
                    and return to the oven for about 10 minutes 
                    for a nice melted cheese topping.
